    "Answer: This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.\n",
